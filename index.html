						<p>Happy New Year!

As part of the new you for 2019 why not start coming out to TRAA General Meetings. That way you're up on the latest details on TRAA news, plans and events.

Also note that with the New Year, it is time to renew your TRAA membership if you haven't already!

As always, guests are always welcome. If you're not a member feel free to drop in and check out what the TRAA is all about.

We meet at the Western Ontario Fish & Game Protective Association clubhouse at 790 Southdale Road, London Ontario.</p>

						<p>TRAA Trout Hatchery</p>
						<p>Brown Trout Eggs Arriving Soon!</p>
					</div>
					<div id="articleTextRight">
						<p>The TRAA trout hatchery is a popular activity of the TRAA as it's a great teaching tool with regard to the life cycle of a trout. Those involved with the hatchery get to see firsthand the development stages of the egg and the fry before their final release destinations to area streams.

Volunteers attend to the operation every day to maintain the health and well-being of the trout. As the saying goes, many hands make light work.

There are ideally 2 members assigned for each day of the week. This is desirable as they can cover for each other and also allows us to match up anyone wanting to "learn the ropes" with an experienced mentor.

At this time there are still openings those wanting to be a part of the trout hatchery rotation. You can <a href="#">Contact Us</a> or attend a TRAA General Meeting (see above) for more info.</p>

Dan Shinkelshoek made a video of the proceedings and it's worth a look so click on the picture to view.

If you have further questions about TRAA stream habitat projects and events, please come out to the TRAA General Meeting on Wednesday, November 14th or <a href="#">Contact Us</a></p>

						<p>TRAA Gear is now available!</p>
						<p>Tee shirts, hats and stickers.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="articleTextLeft">
						<p>Many of you have already ordered the TRAA tee shirts, but if you haven't you had better hurry because many sizes are almost sold out! These are a steal at $15 each.

There are three different hat colours available: Clay Grey, Burnt Orange and Taupe. If you thought the tee's were a good deal, all three editions of these hats are also priced at $15 each.

We now have some nice stickers featuring the TRAA logo that you can display on your vehicle, boat, lunchbox or wherever you like. These are $2 each but you get one for joining the TRAA as a member or renewing an existing TRAA membership.

Get your TRAA Gear (makes a great Christmas gift!) at any TRAA event, such as this coming General Meeting.</p>
